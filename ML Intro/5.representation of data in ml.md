# Representation of Data for learning

**Example: House Prices Dataset**

Consider a dataset containing information about houses and their prices. Hereâ€™s a simplified version of such a dataset:

| Size (sq ft) | Bedrooms | Distance to City Center (miles) | Price ($) |
|---------------|----------|---------------------------------|------------|
| 1500          | 3        | 10                              | 300,000    |
| 2000          | 4        | 5                               | 400,000    |
| 2500          | 5        | 12                              | 500,000    |
| 1800          | 3        | 8                               | 350,000    |

In this example:
- Each row represents a single house.
- Each column represents a specific attribute or feature of the houses:
  - **Size (sq ft)**: The size of the house in square feet.
  - **Bedrooms**: The number of bedrooms in the house.
  - **Distance to City Center (miles)**: The distance of the house from the city center.
  - **Price ($)**: The price of the house in dollars.


### Feature Vector

**Definition in Simple Terms:** A feature vector is a list of numbers that describe a single instance (or sample) in a dataset.

**Example using the House Prices Dataset:**
- Each house in our dataset can be represented as a feature vector.
- For instance, the first house with Size = 1500 sq ft, Bedrooms = 3, Distance to City Center = 10 miles, and Price = $300,000 can be represented as the following feature vector:
  Feature Vector 1 = [1500, 3, 10] 
- Similarly, the feature vector for the second house (Size = 2000 sq ft, Bedrooms = 4, Distance to City Center = 5 miles, Price = $400,000) would be:
  Feature Vector 2 = [2000, 4, 5] 

### Feature Spaces

**Definition in Simple Terms:** A feature space is the set of all possible combinations of feature values that describe instances in a dataset.

**Example using the House Prices Dataset:**
- In our dataset, the feature space is defined by the possible combinations of Size, Bedrooms, and Distance to City Center.
- Each house represents a point in this three-dimensional feature space.
- For example, the first house (1500 sq ft, 3 bedrooms, 10 miles) occupies a specific point in the feature space defined by these dimensions.

### Feature Extraction

**Definition in Simple Terms:** Feature extraction is the process of creating new features or transforming existing features to make them more informative for machine learning algorithms.

**Example using the House Prices Dataset:**
- Suppose we want to extract a new feature called "Price per Square Foot" from our dataset.
- We can calculate this new feature by dividing the Price ($) by the Size (sq ft) for each house.
- For instance, the "Price per Square Foot" for the first house (Size = 1500 sq ft, Price = $300,000) would be:
 Price per Square Foot 1 = 300,000 / 1500 = 200 dollars per sq ft

### Feature Selection

**Definition in Simple Terms:** Feature selection involves choosing the most relevant features from the dataset to improve model performance and efficiency.

**Example using the House Prices Dataset:**
- Suppose we have additional features in our dataset, such as "Year Built" and "Neighborhood".
- If these features are not significantly correlated with the house prices, we might decide to exclude them during feature selection to simplify the model.
- Thus, after feature selection, our dataset might only include Size, Bedrooms, and Distance to City Center as the relevant features for predicting house prices.

### Summary

- **Feature Vector:** A list of numbers representing an instance in a dataset (e.g., a house).
- **Feature Space:** The set of all possible combinations of feature values that describe instances in a dataset.
- **Feature Extraction:** Creating new features or transforming existing features to enhance the dataset's information.
- **Feature Selection:** Choosing the most relevant features to improve model accuracy and efficiency.

These concepts are essential in preparing data for machine learning tasks, ensuring that models can effectively learn patterns and make predictions based on the features provided.
