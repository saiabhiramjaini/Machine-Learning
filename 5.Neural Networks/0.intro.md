# Neural Networks

A neural network is a type of computer system modeled after the human brain. It's made up of layers of tiny units called **neurons** (or nodes), which are connected to each other like a web. Here's a simple breakdown:

1. **Neurons**: Think of them as decision-makers. Each neuron receives input, processes it, and passes it on to the next layer of neurons.
2. **Layers**: Neural networks have three types of layers:
   - **Input layer**: This is where data (like images or numbers) enters the network.
   - **Hidden layers**: These layers do the heavy lifting by processing the data. The network can have one or many hidden layers.
   - **Output layer**: This layer gives the final result, like predicting whether an image is of a cat or a dog.
3. **Learning**: The network learns by adjusting connections between neurons based on the errors it makes. This process, called **training**, helps the network improve over time.

### What is a Neuron? 

A neuron is the fundamental building block of an artificial neural network, which is inspired by the structure of neurons in the human brain. A neuron, also known as a node or a unit, receives one or more inputs, performs a computation on those inputs, and produces an output. 

   `Neuron output = Activation function(∑(Weight * Input) + Bias)`

If a neuron is used in a neural network to predict whether an image contains a cat, the neuron might receive input values like pixel brightness. It will process these inputs using weights and biases, pass the result through an activation function, and give an output like "yes, it's a cat" or "no, it's not."


## How does a neural network work

A neural network works by mimicking how the brain processes information. Here’s a simple step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

#### 1. **Input Data**
   - The neural network starts with the **input layer**, where you provide data, such as images, text, or numbers. Each piece of data is represented as a number (like pixel values for images).

#### 2. **Passing Through Layers**
   - After the input layer, the data moves through one or more **hidden layers**. Each neuron in these layers takes the input, processes it, and passes it to the next layer. These layers are called "hidden" because they are not visible to the user—they do the complex work behind the scenes.

#### 3. **Neurons' Work**
   - Each neuron in the hidden layers takes inputs from the previous layer, multiplies them by a **weight** (a number that the network learns), adds a **bias** (another number), and then passes the result through an **activation function**. This function helps decide whether the neuron should activate (send its signal forward) or not. 

   Here's a simplified formula:

   `Neuron output = Activation function(∑(Weight * Input) + Bias)`


#### 4. **Output Layer**
   - After passing through the hidden layers, the data reaches the **output layer**, which gives the final result. For example, if you're trying to classify an image as either a cat or a dog, the output layer might give you two numbers representing the likelihood of the image being either.

#### 5. **Training the Network**
   - In the beginning, the network makes a lot of mistakes. It compares the predicted output with the correct answer (called **ground truth**). The difference between them is called **error** or **loss**.
   - The network learns by using an algorithm called **backpropagation**, which adjusts the weights and biases based on the errors. It does this repeatedly for many rounds, called **epochs**, until the network becomes good at predicting the right answers.

#### 6. **Learning from Data**
   - As the network processes more and more examples, it learns to recognize patterns in the data, improving its accuracy over time. This learning process is called **training**.




### Applications of NNs: 

- **Image Recognition and Computer Vision:** NNs are extensively used in tasks such as object detection, image classification, facial recognition, and image segmentation. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a specialized type of ANN, excel in processing visual data. 

- **Speech Recognition:** NNs are used in speech recognition systems to convert spoken language into text. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly employed in this domain. 

- **Healthcare:** NNs are used for disease diagnosis, medical image analysis, drug discovery, patient monitoring, and personalized treatment recommendation systems. 

- **Finance:** NNs are applied in stock market prediction, fraud detection, credit scoring, algorithmic trading, risk assessment, and portfolio management. 

- **Autonomous Vehicles:** NNs play a crucial role in self-driving cars for tasks such as object detection, lane keeping, path planning, and decision-making. 

- **Robotics:** NNs are used in robotics for tasks such as robot navigation, object manipulation, grasping, and control. 

- **Marketing and Customer Relationship Management (CRM):** NNs are used for customer segmentation, churn prediction, recommendation systems, and targeted advertising. 

- **Environmental Science:** NNs are utilized in environmental modelling, climate prediction, pollution monitoring, and ecological forecasting.
