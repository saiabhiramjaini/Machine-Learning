# Random Forest

## Introduction
Random Forest is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to create a more robust and accurate predictive model. It was introduced as an improvement over single decision trees to reduce overfitting and improve predictive performance.

## Key Concepts

### Decision Trees
- Random Forests are built on the concept of decision trees.
- Each tree is built from a subset of the training data and a subset of the features.

### Ensemble Learning
- Random Forests use ensemble learning to improve the predictive performance.
- They combine multiple decision trees to reduce overfitting and improve accuracy.

### Randomness
- Random Forest introduces randomness by selecting random subsets of the features and random samples of the data for each tree.
- This randomness helps in creating diverse trees which, when combined, produce robust predictions.

### How Random Forest Works
- **Random Sampling of Data:** Random Forest creates multiple decision trees using different subsets of the training data, generated by random sampling with replacement (bagging).

- **Random Feature Selection:** For each decision tree, Random Forest randomly selects a subset of features to consider for splitting at each node. This introduces diversity among the trees.

- **Voting (for Classification):** In the case of classification, each tree in the forest makes a prediction, and the final prediction is based on the majority vote of all trees.

- **Averaging (for Regression):** In regression tasks, the final prediction is the average of the predictions made by all the trees in the forest.

## Advantages
- Handles high-dimensional data well.
- Less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees.
- Can handle missing values and maintain accuracy.

## Disadvantages of Random Forest
- Complexity: Although Random Forest improves performance, it is more complex and less interpretable than a single decision tree.

- Computationally Intensive: Training multiple decision trees can be computationally expensive, especially with large datasets.
