# Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a fundamental supervised machine learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks, predicting the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more independent variables.


## Types of Logistic Regression
On the basis of the categories, Logistic Regression can be classified into three types:

### Binomial:
In binomial Logistic regression, there can be only two possible types of the dependent variables, such as 0 or 1, Pass or Fail, etc.
    
- Equation: Sigmoid function => Y = 1/ (1+e^-(β0 + β1X)) 

### Multinomial: 

In multinomial Logistic regression, there can be 3 or more possible unordered types of the dependent variable, such as “cat”, “dogs”, or “sheep”

### Ordinal:
In ordinal Logistic regression, there can be 3 or more possible ordered types of dependent variables, such as “low”, “Medium”, or “High”.

## Logistic Regression Curve

- **Objective:** Models the probability of a binary outcome using a logistic function, visualized with a sigmoid curve.

## Cost Function for Logistic Regression

In logistic regression, the cost function (log loss or cross-entropy) measures the performance of the model by calculating the difference between predicted probabilities and actual labels.

## Gradient Descent for Logistic Regression

Logistic regression uses gradient descent to optimize model parameters (β0, β1, ...) iteratively, aiming to minimize the cost function and improve prediction accuracy.

## Logistic Regression Example: Predicting Customer Churn

Suppose we have a dataset of customer information and their churn status (churned/not churned). We want to use logistic regression to predict the probability of churn based on customer demographics and behavior.

### Data

| Customer ID | Age | Monthly Charges ($) | Churn (1/0) |
|-------------|-----|---------------------|-------------|
| 1           | 45  | 70                  | 1           |
| 2           | 30  | 50                  | 0           |
| 3           | 55  | 80                  | 1           |
| 4           | 35  | 60                  | 0           |

### Calculations

To find the logistic regression equation, we calculate the coefficients (β0, β1, ...) using the given data points and apply the sigmoid function to predict the probability of churn.

### Prediction

Now, let's predict the probability of churn for a customer with age 40 and monthly charges $75 using logistic regression.

Suppose we have the following assumed values for the coefficients (β0, β1, β2):

β0 (Intercept): -1.5

β1 (Age Coefficient): 0.05

β2 (Monthly Charges Coefficient): -0.02


Substituting the values in the logistic regression equation:

P(Y=1|X) = 1 / (1 + e^-(β0 + β1*Age + β2*Monthly Charges))

P(Y=1∣X) ≈ 0.6225 

If the threshold is 0.5(normally) then we can say that the churn value will be '1' (0.6225 > 0.5).

Logistic regression is a versatile algorithm for binary and multinomial classification tasks, providing interpretable probabilities and insights into predictive modeling.

| Requires a linear relationship between variables.           | Does not require a linear relationship between variables.       |
| May have collinearity between independent variables.        | Should not have collinearity between independent variables.     |
| Output is continuous (e.g., price, age).                    | Output is categorical (e.g., 0 or 1, Yes or No).                |
