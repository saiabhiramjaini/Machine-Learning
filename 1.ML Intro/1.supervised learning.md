## Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, the machine is trained on a set of labeled data, which means that the input data is paired with the desired output. The machine then learns to predict the output for new input data. 

**The main goal of the supervised learning technique is to map the input variable(x) with the output variable(y).**

Supervised learning, as the name indicates, has the presence of a supervisor as a teacher. Supervised learning is when we teach or train the machine using data that is well-labelled. Which means some data is already tagged with the correct answer. After that, the machine is provided with a new set of examples(data) so that the supervised learning algorithm analyses the training data(set of training examples) and produces a correct outcome from labeled data.

For example, a labeled dataset of images of Elephant, Camel and Cow would have each image tagged with either “Elephant” , “Camel”or “Cow.”

## Types of Supervised Machine Learning:

**Regression:**
- Regression algorithms are used to solve regression problems in which there is a linear relationship between input and output variables.
- These are used to predict continuous output variables, such as market trends, weather prediction, etc.
- Some common regression algorithms include:
    - Linear Regression
    - Polynomial Regression
    - Support Vector Machine Regression
    - Decision Tree Regression
    - Random Forest Regression

**Classification:**
- Classification algorithms are used to solve classification problems in which the output variable is categorical, such as "Yes" or "No", "Male" or "Female", "Red" or "Blue", etc.
- The classification algorithms predict the categories present in the dataset.
- Some real-world examples of classification algorithms are Spam Detection, Email filtering, etc.
- Some common classification algorithms include:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Support Vector Machines
    - Decision Trees
    - Random Forests
    - Naive Baye


## Advantages of Supervised learning
- Supervised learning allows collecting data and produces data output from previous experiences.
- Helps to optimize performance criteria with the help of experience.
- Supervised machine learning helps to solve various types of real-world computation problems.
- It performs classification and regression tasks.
- It allows estimating or mapping the result to a new sample. 
- We have complete control over choosing the number of classes we want in the training data.

## Disadvantages of Supervised learning
- Classifying big data can be challenging.
- Training for supervised learning needs a lot of computation time. So, it requires a lot of time.
- Supervised learning cannot handle all complex tasks in Machine Learning.
- Computation time is vast for supervised learning.
- It requires a labelled data set.
- It requires a training process.


## Applications of Supervised learning
Supervised learning can be used to solve a wide variety of problems, including:

- Spam filtering
- Image classification
- Medical diagnosis
- Fraud detection
- Natural language processing (NLP)
