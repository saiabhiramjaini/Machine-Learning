### Overfitting, Underfitting, and Best Fit

These terms describe how well a machine learning model performs on both the training data and unseen data (e.g., validation or test data).

#### 1. **Overfitting:**
   - **Definition:** Overfitting occurs when a model learns not only the underlying patterns in the training data but also the noise and details that are specific to that particular dataset. As a result, the model performs very well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.
   - **Symptoms:** The model has very low error on the training data but high error on the validation/test data.
   - **Example:** Imagine you're trying to fit a curve to a set of data points. An overfitted model might create a very complex curve that passes through every single point, including outliers, even if that doesn't reflect the true underlying pattern.
   - **What Happens:** The model becomes too specific to the training data and loses its ability to generalize to new data.

#### 2. **Underfitting:**
   - **Definition:** Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern of the data. This happens when the model doesn't have enough capacity (e.g., too few parameters) or hasn't been trained long enough.
   - **Symptoms:** The model has high error on both the training data and the validation/test data.
   - **Example:** Using a straight line to fit a set of points that actually follow a complex curve. The line doesn't capture the pattern well, leading to poor performance.
   - **What Happens:** The model fails to capture the complexities of the data, resulting in poor performance on both the training and test sets.

#### 3. **Best Fit (Good Fit):**
   - **Definition:** A model that achieves the best fit balances complexity and accuracy. It captures the underlying patterns in the data without being too complex or too simple, performing well on both the training and unseen data.
   - **Symptoms:** The model has low error on both the training and validation/test data, indicating it generalizes well.
   - **Example:** If the true relationship in the data is a curve, a best-fit model would find that curve, fitting most data points well without overcomplicating the model with unnecessary details.
   - **What Happens:** The model generalizes well, making accurate predictions on new data.

### Visual Example


- **Underfit:** The model is too simple to capture the data (e.g., a straight line through a complex pattern).
- **Best Fit:** The model fits the main trend in the data without being too simple or too complex (e.g., a smooth curve that captures the overall pattern).
- **Overfit:** The model fits the noise in the training data (e.g., a wiggly curve with many bends).
