### Balanced vs. Unbalanced Datasets

**Balanced Dataset:**
- A balanced dataset is one where each class (or category) in the dataset has an approximately equal number of examples.
- **Example:** If you're building a model to classify images of cats and dogs, a balanced dataset might have 1,000 images of cats and 1,000 images of dogs.

**Unbalanced Dataset:**
- An unbalanced dataset is one where the classes have a significantly different number of examples.
- **Example:** Using the same cat and dog classifier, if you have 1,000 images of cats but only 100 images of dogs, the dataset is unbalanced.

### What Happens if the Dataset is Unbalanced?

If the dataset is unbalanced, it can lead to several problems:

1. **Model Bias:** The model might become biased towards the class with more examples. For example, if the dataset has many more images of cats than dogs, the model might learn to predict "cat" more often, even when the image is of a dog.

2. **Poor Performance on Minority Class:** The model might perform well on the majority class (the class with more data) but poorly on the minority class. In the example, the model might accurately classify cats but often misclassify dogs.

3. **Misleading Accuracy:** The overall accuracy might seem high, but it can be misleading. If 90% of your data is of cats, a model that always predicts "cat" will be 90% accurate, but it won't actually be useful for identifying dogs.

### Handling Unbalanced Datasets

To address the problems caused by an unbalanced dataset, you can:

1. **Resample the Dataset:**
   - **Oversampling** the minority class (e.g., duplicating dog images).
   - **Undersampling** the majority class (e.g., reducing the number of cat images).

2. **Use Different Metrics:** Instead of accuracy, use metrics like precision, recall, or F1-score, which provide a better understanding of the modelâ€™s performance on the minority class.
