# Loss/Error in Machine Learning

In machine learning, **loss** or **error** quantifies the difference between the predicted output of a model and the actual target values. The goal of training a model is to minimize this loss, which indicates better model performance and predictive accuracy.

### Common Loss/Error Metrics

1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
2. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
3. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
4. **R-squared (R²)**

### 1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

**Definition**:  
MAE is the average of the absolute differences between the predicted values and the actual values. It measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction (positive or negative).

**Formula**:

**Calculation Method**:
1. Calculate the absolute difference between each predicted value and the corresponding actual value.
2. Sum all these absolute differences.
3. Divide by the number of data points \( n \).

**Interpretation**:  
MAE gives an easily interpretable metric in the same units as the data. Lower MAE values indicate better model performance.

### 2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)

**Definition**:  
MSE is the average of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values. Squaring the errors emphasizes larger errors, making MSE sensitive to outliers.

**Formula**:

**Calculation Method**:
1. Calculate the squared difference between each predicted value and the corresponding actual value.
2. Sum all these squared differences.
3. Divide by the number of data points \( n \).

**Interpretation**:  
MSE provides a measure that penalizes larger errors more than smaller ones. A lower MSE indicates a model that better fits the data.

### 3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

**Definition**:  
RMSE is the square root of the MSE. It provides an error metric that is in the same units as the data, making it easier to interpret.

**Formula**:

**Interpretation**:  
RMSE is more interpretable than MSE because it is in the same units as the target variable. It also emphasizes larger errors but in a way that is more interpretable than MSE alone.

### 4. R-squared (R²)

**Definition**:  
R², also known as the coefficient of determination, measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. It indicates how well the model fits the data.

**Formula**:

**Calculation Method**:
1. Calculate the total sum of squares (TSS), which measures the total variance in the target values.
2. Calculate the residual sum of squares (RSS), which measures the variance unexplained by the model.
3. Compute \( R^2 \) using the formula.

**Interpretation**:  
- \( R^2 \) ranges from 0 to 1.
- \( R^2 = 1 \) indicates a perfect fit.
- \( R^2 = 0 \) indicates that the model does not explain any of the variance.
- Negative \( R^2 \) values indicate that the model performs worse than a horizontal line.


### 5. Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)

**Definition**:  
SSE is the sum of the squared differences between each predicted value and the corresponding actual value. It provides a measure of the total discrepancy between the model's predictions and the actual data.

**Formula**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49c56153-a1e2-4d50-93c8-6b4e35e15ec9)

**Calculation Method**:
- Calculate the squared difference between each predicted value and the actual value.
- Sum all these squared differences.

**Interpretation**:  
- SSE provides a measure of the total error in the model's predictions.
- Larger SSE values indicate a poorer fit of the model to the data.
- SSE is sensitive to outliers due to the squaring of errors.



### Summary

- **MAE** measures average absolute errors and is less sensitive to outliers.
- **MSE** squares errors to emphasize larger ones, providing a quadratic loss.
- **RMSE** is the square root of MSE, offering interpretability in the same units as the data.
- **R²** indicates how well the model explains the variance in the data, with higher values indicating better performance.
- **SSE** quantifies the total error by summing the squared differences between predicted and actual values, emphasizing larger errors and being sensitive to outliers.

These metrics are crucial in evaluating and comparing the performance of machine learning models, each offering unique insights into how well a model fits the data.
