# What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a subdomain of computer science that focuses on algorithms which help a computer learn from data without explicit programming.

The primary goal of machine learning is to develop algorithms that can learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. This involves: 

- **Learning from Data:** ML algorithms are trained on large amounts of data to learn patterns, relationships, and structures within the data. This data can be in the form of labeled examples (supervised learning), unlabelled data (unsupervised learning), or a combination of both. 

- **Making Predictions or Decisions:** Once trained, ML models can be used to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. These predictions or decisions can range from classifying objects, predicting future outcomes, clustering similar data points, or even generating new data. 


## Al vs ML vs DL vs DS

**Artificial intelligence** is an area of computer science, where the goal is to enable computers and machines to perform human-like tasks and simulate human behavior.

**Machine learning** is subset of Al that tries to solve a specific problem and make predictions using data

**Deep learning** is a powerful AI technique inspired by the brain. It uses layered neural networks to learn complex patterns from huge amounts of data, enabling machines to perform tasks like image recognition and speech translation with impressive accuracy.

**Data science** is a field that attempts to find patterns and draw insights from data (might use ML!)
