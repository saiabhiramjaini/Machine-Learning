## Unsupervised Learning

In unsupervised learning, the machine is trained on a set of unlabeled data, which means that the input data is not paired with the desired output. The machine then learns to find patterns and relationships in the data.

**The main aim of the unsupervised learning algorithm is to group or categories the unsorted dataset according to the similarities, patterns, and differences. Machines are instructed to find the hidden patterns from the input dataset.**

Unlike supervised learning, no teacher is provided that means no training will be given to the machine. Therefore the machine is restricted to find the hidden structure in unlabeled data by itself. 

You can use unsupervised learning to examine the animal data that has been gathered and distinguish between several groups according to the traits and actions of the animals. These groupings might correspond to various animal species, providing you to categorize the creatures without depending on labels that already exist.


## Types of Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is classified into two categories of algorithms: 

- **Clustering:** A clustering problem is where you want to discover the inherent groupings in the data, such as grouping customers by purchasing behavior.
- Some common clustering algorithms include:

- **Association:** An association rule learning problem is where you want to discover rules that describe large portions of your data, such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y.


## Advantages of Unsupervised learning
- It does not require training data to be labeled.
- Dimensionality reduction can be easily accomplished using unsupervised learning. 
- Capable of finding previously unknown patterns in data.
- Unsupervised learning can help you gain insights from unlabeled data that you might not have been able to get otherwise.
- Unsupervised learning is good at finding patterns and relationships in data without being told what to look for. This can help you learn new things about your data.


## Disadvantages of Unsupervised learning
- Difficult to measure accuracy or effectiveness due to lack of predefined answers during training. 
- The results often have lesser accuracy.
- The user needs to spend time interpreting and label the classes which follow that classification.
- Unsupervised learning can be sensitive to data quality, including missing values, outliers, and noisy data.
- Without labeled data, it can be difficult to evaluate the performance of unsupervised learning models, making it challenging to assess their effectiveness.

## Application of Unsupervised learning
Non-supervised learning can be used to solve a wide variety of problems, including:

- Anomaly detection
- Scientific discovery
- Recommendation systems
- Customer segmentation
- Image analysis
